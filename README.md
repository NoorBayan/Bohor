Welcome to the **Bohor (بُحُور)** corpus project! Bohor is a meticulously crafted, machine-readable dataset designed to capture the rich and intricate system of classical Arabic poetry's meters (known as *buḥūr*). This resource aims to empower researchers, linguists, and developers in the fields of computational linguistics, digital humanities, and Arabic literature studies.

## What is Bohor?

The Bohor corpus offers a deep and structured representation of the 16 canonical meters of classical Arabic poetry, as established by the foundational work of Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi. Unlike many existing resources that focus primarily on high-level meter classification, Bohor delves into the granular details of prosodic structure, including:

*   **Metrical Feet (Tafʿīlāt - تفعيلات):** The fundamental rhythmic units.
*   **Permissible Variations (Zihāfāt - زحافات & ʿIlāl - علل):** The subtle yet crucial modifications that poets use to achieve rhythmic diversity and expressiveness.
*   **Rhyme System (Qāfiyah - قافية):** Detailed components and rules governing poetic rhyme.

Our goal is to provide a definitive, computationally accessible reference for the theoretical space of Arabic prosody.

## Core Objectives

*   **To provide an exhaustive inventory:** Cataloging all theoretically valid metrical patterns based on classical prosodic rules.
*   **To facilitate fine-grained analysis:** Enabling detailed scansion and rhythmic study beyond simple meter identification.
*   **To support AI and NLP development:** Offering a robust dataset for training and evaluating computational models for Arabic poetry.
*   **To bridge traditional scholarship and modern computation:** Translating classical prosodic knowledge into a structured, machine-readable format.
*   **To promote open research:** Making this valuable resource freely available to the academic community.

## Key Highlights

*   **Unprecedented Granularity:** Detailed encoding of metrical feet, their transformations, sub-syllabic components, and rhyme structures.
*   **Theoretical Rigor:** Grounded in six authoritative classical Arabic prosody treatises.
*   **Systematic Generation & Validation:** Patterns were algorithmically generated based on a formal mathematical model and subsequently validated through expert review and empirical testing.
*   **Probabilistic Ranking for Ambiguity:** Includes a mechanism to suggest the most likely scansion for metrically ambiguous lines based on statistical analysis of attested poetic usage.
*   **Robust to Unvocalized Text:** Engineered to handle raw and partially diacritized Arabic poetry, resolving combinatorial ambiguity through probabilistic ranking without requiring full vocalization.
*   **Machine-Readiness:** Structured data formats for easy integration into computational workflows.

## Dataset Overview

### Content and Scope

The Bohor corpus encompasses:

*   **16 Canonical Meters:** All traditional meters defined by Al-Khalil.
*   **24 Meter Variants:** Including structurally distinct sub-forms (e.g., *tāmm* - complete, *majzūʾ* - catalectic).
*   **Exhaustive Metrical Space (76,700 Patterns):** Exactly maps all 76,700 mathematically admissible metrical configurations across classical meters and their permissible variations.
*   **Detailed Annotations for each pattern:**
    *   Rhythmic encoding (binary-like representation of short/long syllables).
    *   Type of metrical transformation applied (*zihāf*, *ʿilal*, or intact).
    *   Decomposition into prosodic sub-units (*awtād*, *asbāb*, *fawāṣil*).
    *   Information related to the *qāfiyah* (rhyme) system.

### Data Format

*(This section requires your specific details. Below is an example; please adapt it accurately.)*

The primary data is provided in **JSON format**, with individual files for each of the 24 meter variants (e.g., `Al_Tawil_Tamm_patterns.json`, `Al_Kamil_Majzu_patterns.json`). Each JSON file contains a list of pattern objects. A pattern object typically includes fields like:

*   `pattern_id`: A unique string identifying the pattern within its meter variant.
*   `meter_name_ar`: Arabic name of the base meter (e.g., "الطويل").
*   `meter_name_en`: English transliteration of the base meter (e.g., "Al-Ṭawīl").
*   `meter_variant_ar`: Arabic name of the meter variant (e.g., "تام").
*   `meter_variant_en`: English transliteration of the meter variant (e.g., "Tāmm").
*   `hemistich_1_tafilat`: A list of *tafʿīlah* objects for the first hemistich.
*   `hemistich_2_tafilat`: A list of *tafʿīlah* objects for the second hemistich.
*   `rhyme_details`: (Optional) An object containing rhyme information if applicable at this level.

Each *tafʿīlah* object within the hemistich lists contains:

*   `name_ar`: Arabic name of the *tafʿīlah* (e.g., "فعولن").
*   `name_en`: English transliteration (e.g., "Faʿūlun").
*   `rhythmic_encoding`: The binary-like string (e.g., "010110").
*   `transformation_type`: Type of metrical change (e.g., "Intact", "Zihāf", "ʿIlal").
*   `specific_transformation_ar`: Arabic name of the specific *zihāf* or *ʿilal* if any (e.g., "قبض").
*   `specific_transformation_en`: English transliteration of the transformation.
*   `sub_units`: A list of prosodic sub-units (*awtād*, *asbāb*, *fawāṣil*) forming the *tafʿīlah*.
